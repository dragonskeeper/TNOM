  <h1>Cody R. Lewis</h1>
	<HR>
  <pre> I am currently in my early 30’s.  I did not graduate high school and I have not done anything really in this life noteworthy.  Before 2022, my trade has been carpentry, home building, remodeling, woodworks, etc.  
	<BR>    
	I have had multiple “run-ins” with the “law”;  and my “criminal” history relates, mostly, to “traffic violations” (in one form or another).  In Utah alone starting in 2009, I have had 50+ “charges” brought against [“me”] with more currently pending.  Now, on paper you may think, I am a “criminal”, with misdemeanors of all classes, violations, infractions, 2 DUI’s with 2 pending, Assaults on Officers, Marijuana Meth and Heroin Possessions, multiple driving without insurance license and registration, obstructing justice, failure to disclose ID, giving false ID’s, speeding, failure to yield, failure to stop at the command of a law officer, alcohol restricted driver, driving without an interlock device, and on and on, Hell, my dogs have gotten me a few because they didn’t have a license; 
	<BR>
however no felonies (yet, but they sure are trying).
