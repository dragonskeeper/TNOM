            <p>
                Once upon a time in America, one could live a happy and enjoyable life.  They could, through hardwork and dedication, find a piece of land and say OK, this is mine.  
                Then use the natural resources around said land, to build him and his shelter to keep dry and warm, and grow food for themselves, money was not everyones top priority;  
                and you could even find it in the ground if you dug long enough and in the right spot.  
                Then, by no fault of their own, the always trustworthy banks, the keepers of your money, lost it...POOF! Presious metals, which have been inside the Earth for 
                <BR>1000's of years turned to smoke in those climate controled rooms which were literally made just for them. (Note : Million dollar Idea : Vaults filled with dirt).  
                So, "Hey! These people are strong, independent, happy, healthy, and capable of taking care of themselves; They need us to make them weak, depressed, sick, lazy, and 
                dependent on us for everything they'll ever need and want, which we'll make them work for us which in return, we'll give them our magical paper so they can buy the 
                things we tell them to." 
            </p><BR>  
            <p><HR>
                Now there's these things called credits and debts:
            </p><BR>
            <pre>
                <b>Credit =</b> no physical money ; your promise ; your signature ; hopes & dreams ; nothing
            </pre><BR>
            <pre>
                <b>Debt =</b> physical money ; Federal Reserve Notes, cash, dollars, $$$, etc. ; real and/or personal property ; 40+ hours a week of your time and labor ; etc.
            </pre><BR>
                <h1>Credit</h1>
            <pre><b>Credit</b></pre> is your <b>promise</b> to <b>pay-back</b> money that was <b>loaned</b> to you.  In reality however,
            no physical money was loaned.   
            
            
            Isn't crazy that humans have evolved enough and have invented a way to go from one place to another quickly and this place has so much material to make them, 
                that almost every single human can get one, if not multiple?</p>
            <p>Now today, for 80-90% of us humans, there is basically two ways to get one of these gizmos:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Have $30,000.00 to $100,000.00 just lying around and buy it yourself; or</li>
                <li>Go to those who somehow were able to capture those ever elusive credits, and ask, "gee, mister if you'll allow me to use some of those sacred credits of yours, i'll return to you double, if not more, of these stinky old debts.</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="scenario">
                <p>Scenario: I'm a big beautiful bank, and you come to me and say, "Mr. big beautiful bank, keeper of dreams, I hopin to have one of those dreams, and even though it's not mine to give and it seems very shady, borderline criminal, i'll offer my dream as collateral and if I miss a payment, you can come take it, keep the money i've already given you, plus if you want to, you can sue me for the rest of the money I owe you, with interest of course and hell i'll even throw in my kin."</p>
                
                <p>And I say, "Hmm, I don't know, i'm taking all risk you know? If you knew what it takes to summon credit you'd apologize for such a risky trade. Well sure on a few conditions: first: for every 1 credit I give, you return 3 to 5 debts every month for 5 to 30 years, and if you don't have any or enough debt on any given month, you'll owe me even more; Second; I'll need you all your personal information, even whats private, which you'll allow me to use and possibly sell to which you receive no money nor will it be applied to what you owe me; and lastly, you tell me what you need and who to get it from and i'll send them my precious credits, you agree that you must not receive them directly, you simple folk cannot be trusted with such knowledge, nor could you comprehend such a power... no it's best you know nothing of this burden. I envy your vacation you call manual labor, just make sure your paycheck comes straight to me. Now fuck off."</p>
