        <basefont size=5; face=grammond>After one year and 3  months  of  learning,  losing,  evolving, 
        trying, failing, jailed, watched, wishing, writing, and waiting,
        There's no better time to apply.
        
        Allow me to bring you to my fantasy world. One where what you are
        taught and told is the truth. One where you don't pay greedy theives
        to be there slaves. One where the people care about others and not 
        whos got more green pieces of paper or numbers in a computer.
        I mean could you imagine a world where productivity was had to further
        everyone and not children who do not know what work is.
        It'd be nice...</basefont>

        <basefont size=5; face=grammond>So, if money is the root of all evil...then get rid of money, no?

        Long ago in a magical land a American could live a good happy life. 
        They could, through hardwork and dedication, find a piece of land and
        say ok, this is mine. Then use the natural resources around said land,
        build shelter to keep dry and warm, grow food for themselves and their 
        own, money was found in the ground, all you had to do is dig. 
        
        Then, some persons, who had magical cookie smelling shit, saw this and 
        thought, "Hey! These people are strong, independent, happy, healthly, 
        and capable of taking care of themselves;  They need us to make them weak, 
        depressed, sick, lazy, and dependant on us for everything they'll ever need 
        and want, which we'll make them work for us which in return, we'll give them 
        our magical paper so they can buy the things we tell them to."</basefont>
        <p>
        <basefont size=5; face=grammond>So, now theres these things called credits and debts.

        Isn't crazy that humans have evolved enough and have invented a way to go from
        one place to another quickly and this place has so much material to make them,
        that almost every single human can get one, if not multiple?
        
        Now today, for 80-90% of us humans, there is basically two ways to get one of 
        these gizmos:
            1. Have $30,000.00 to $100,000.00 just lying around and but it yourself; or
            2. Go to those who somehow were able to capture those ever elusive credits, 
               and ask, "gee, mister if you'll allow me to use some of those sacred credits 
               of yours, i'll return to you double, if not more, of these stinky old debts.
        
        Are you starting to get it? 
        Credit = hopes and dreams, imainary, just 1's and 0's in a eletronic box; and
        Debt = Is that money you trade 40 to 100 hours of your time and skills every week for, 
               which after trading your time and skill every week for those things that has
               control every decision you've ever made. 
        
        Scenerio: I'm a big beautiful bank, and you come to me and say, "Mr. big beautiful bank,
        keeper of dreams, I hopin to have one of those dreams, and even though it's not mine to 
        give and it seems very shading, boardline criminal, i'll offer my dream as collateral 
        and if I miss a payment, you can come take it, keep the money i've already given you, plus
        if you want to, you can sue me for the rest of the money I owe you, with interest of course
        and hell i'll even throw in my kin."
        And I say,"Hmm, I don't know, i'm taking all risk you know? If you knew what it takes to summon
        credit you'd apologize for such a risky trade. Well sure on a few conditions: first: for every
        1 credit I give, you return 3 to 5 debts every month for 5 to 30 years, and if you don't have any
        or enough debt on any given month, you'll owe me even more; Second; I'll need you all your personal
        information, even whats private, which you'll allow me to use and possibly sell to which you recieve 
        no money nor will it be applied to what you owe me; and lastly, you tell me what you need and who to 
        get it from and i'll send them my precious credits, you agree that you must not recieve them directly,
        you simple folk cannot be trusted with such knowledge, nor could you comprehend such a power... no it's 
        best you know nothing of this burden. I envy your vacition you call manual labor, just make sure your
        paycheck comes straight to me. Now fuck off."</basefont>
